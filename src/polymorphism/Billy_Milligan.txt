William Stanley Milligan :
  (Billy)   PARENT CLASS

INTERFACES:
  SpeakWithAccent; CriminalTendencies; ControlFreak; Talented;



Philip: Has accent(Brooklyn), criminal tendencies(the thug);
April:  Has accent(Boston), criminal tendencies(wants to kill Billi's stepfather);
Arthur: Has accent(British), control freak;
Christopher: talented (plays the harmonica);
Adalana: talented (writes poetry); criminal tendencies(raper);






Philip extends Billy implements SpeakWithAccent, CriminalTendencies;

Billy personality1 = new Philip();

Billy thinks he is Philip. But Billy has no access to what Philip does/can do;



=======================================================
Example of methods behaviour in Polymorphism:


William Stanley Milligan :
  (Billy)   PARENT CLASS
hasIssue(){ hates his stepfather };

April extends Billy(){
	Override: hasIssue() { wants to kill his stepfather };
}

Billy billy = new Billy();
Billy personality2 = new April();

Billy thinks he is April, because of the childhood trauma he hates his father, but when he is April his hate becomes stronger => wants to kill him.

Billy             and           April
hates his sf       =>       hates his sf(wants to kill)

So Billy JUST hates() but when Billy=April hates(upgraded);
